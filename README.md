| 1 | Program to find the number of vertices, even vertices, odd vertices and number of edges in a Graph. | 20th August 2020 | [![Java](https://img.icons8.com/color/40/000000/java-coffee-cup-logo.png)](src/Lab1.java) |  
| 2 | Program to Find Union, Intersection and ring-sum of 2 graphs. | | [![Java](https://img.icons8.com/color/40/000000/java-coffee-cup-logo.png)](src/Lab2.java)|
| 3 | Program to Find Minimum Spanning tree Using Prim's Algorithm | | [![Java](https://img.icons8.com/color/40/000000/java-coffee-cup-logo.png)](src/Lab3.java) |
| 4 | Program to Find Minimum Spanning tree Using Kruskal's Algorithm | | |
| 5 | Program to find Shortest Path between 2 Vertices using Dijkstra Algorithm | | |
| 6 | Program to find Shortest Path between every pair of vertices in a graph using Floyd-Warshall's Algorithm | | |
| 7 | Program to find Shortest Path between 2 Vertices using Bellman Ford's Algorithm | | |
| 8 | Program For finding maximum Matching for bipartite graph | | |
| 9 | Program For finding maximum Matching for General Path | | |
| 9 | Program to find maximum flow from source node to sink node using Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm | | | 

The above programs only contain driver code and main logic has been encapsulated inside the
Graph Classes, namely:
